## Invite-list

This is a tiny cmd for my **Intercom** application.

### Install and run
Install the binary
```bash
$ make install
```
and run it
```bash
$ customers -h
```

### Greetings
Hello team)

### Approach
I decided to not overthink this task, so the code is simple and
not optimized.<br />
Optimization makes sense only if there are constraints such as:
- number of customers
- runtime limit
- memory limit
- output format
- reading input from a network
- compressed input file
- many input files

### Stuff to add
- CI/CD scripts
- Benchmarks
- Platform & architecture supporting releases
